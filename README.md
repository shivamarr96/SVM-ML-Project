# SVM-ML-Project
Classification of authors using SVM

TASK 1
(ml1.ipynb):
Loaded the 4 files separately and checked the Test and Train accuracy without changing the parameters. Made a table for this and understood how it changes with increasing the dataset.

TASK 2
(ml2.ipynb):
Played around with parameters and check the accuracy again. Used the kernel and C parameters for this. Kernel can be rbf, linear or poly. Made a table for these as well which helped me understand how these functions work.

TASK 3
(ml3.ipynb):
In the dataset, I dropped the 4 columns with low values for pre-processing and normalised the dataset using min-max scaling, however the accuracy came out to be less after the normalisation.This helped me learn more about the accuracy and the model by making a table for before and after normalisation results for various datasets.
